# Final-Ball-Game
For my Final Project, I created a video game, basically in this game you try to pop as many bubbles as you can, there are three levels in the game. In each level, you get a different level of diffculty with smaller bubbles for the harder options. A the end of the game, you will get your score. The project uses two external liberiers one for audio and one for buttton called clickable. The program also uses a class to define the bubble which looks like a circle. I made a model in Blender and I took it to substance painter and then I exported the texture and used it as an asset for background for the title screen and the game over screen. The buttons used in the title page and the last page (gameover page) are derived from the external clickable library. The sound effects used from another library. The buttons in the title page are used to select any of the three levels of the game. The button in the last page is used to restart the game.  The program uses switch statement to select each page.
