# Final-Ball-Game
For my Final Project, I created a video game, basically in this game you try to pop as many bubble as you can, there are three levels in the game. Each level, you have a higher diffculty and he bubble is smaller. A the End of the game, they give you your score. he project two external liberiers one for audio and one for buttton called clickable, the program also uses a class to define the bubble which looks like a circle. I made a model in Blender and I took it to substance painter and then I exported the texture of my Charter, and I used it for an asset in back ground for the title screen and the game over screen. I used a library called clickable to desgin my buttons. The buttons are used to select any of the any of the three levels of the game. I have also created a class to draw the bubble.
